                    Sometimes an MVC can be very complex or overly packed with different features. 
                    With <u>jFW Framework</u>, we prefer to keep it simple. You have the ability 
                    to add on as you wish and the most basic of things are here for you.

                    Don't let all of the extras slow you down. Come try us out if all you are looking 
                    for is the basics to build from yourself.

                        Working on a project can be fun but if you have too much all at once 
                        then it's just a lot of overhead you don't need. <u>jFW Framework</u> 
                        doesn't have all the bells and whistles because we don't need all the noise. 
                        Some basic functionality we do have?

        We encourage anyone using the program to make additional functionality as they please
